## Project Overview
The Inspector product by Acme robotics is one of its flagship products. It performs warehouse infrastructure leakage inspection and gives the location of the leak in the environment and also a photo of the leakage. The user can then decide based on the photo how serious the leakage is actually and based on the leakage coordinates can track down the leakage. The Inpector runs utilizes the famous turtlebot platform, equipped with a LIDAR sensor to find distance from the wall and a RGBD camera to take photos of the leakages.

## Operation
To be uploaded

## Program installation
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ cd src/
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/hrishikeshtawade04/the_inspector.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```
Before building the model we need to move the my_Wall file which is in World folder to .gazebo/models/.
Execute below commands in new terminal.
```
$ cd ~/.gazebo/models/
$ mv <path to repository>/Wall/my_Wall ./
```
## Instructions to run program

To run code using launch command, open a new terminal window and run following command
```
$ cd <path to catkin_ws>
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch the_inspector runTheInspector.launch
```

## Running ROS test via command-line
The test is written using gtest and rostest. Close all the running processes before executing the commands below to run the rostest.
```
$ cd <path to catkin Workspace>
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ catkin_make run_tests_the_inspector
```
Or test using launch file
```
$ cd <path to catkin Workspace>
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rostest the_inspector inspect.launch
```
